autoimport is meant to complement automaker, for a quick development process.

Generally, autoimport looks at all selected files--given as commandline arguments--for each file, autoimport looks for a comment at the top of the file, with a list of lines of the form "%use x;" To automaker, "%use x;" means "import the file x.c from an autoimport repository.

Sample autoimport C file header, "sample.c" (excluding the ----------) :
--------------------------
/*
%use apple;
%use banana;
%use cupcake;
%use donut;
*/
--------------------------

Assuming the above header is the top of "sample.c", typing:
$ autoimport -r /usr/local/autoimport sample.c
would import apple.c, banana.c, cupcake.c, and donut.c, and any of their dependencies--recursively--from /usr/local/autoimport.
